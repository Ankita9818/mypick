steps: Git branch ,rebase , merge
1:  mkdir project1
		mkdir project2
2:  git branch staging
		git checkout staging
4:	git add text1.txt
5:	git push --set-upstream origin staging		//push at remote branch
6:	cd project2
7:	git clone <url> clone_name
8:  git checkout staging
10: git add .
git commit -m "msg"
11: cd project1
12: git checkout staging
14: when pushing the changes, an error occurred- "failed to push some references" because it had to pull first.
		git pull
15: git checkout -b master
16: git merge staging				//	merged staging in master
17:	git checkout -b testing
18:	git add .
		git commit -m "testing branch's commit"
20:	git push --set-upstream origin staging		//push at remote branch
21:	 git checkout master
22:  git add .
		 git commit -m "msg"
24:	 git push origin master
25:	 git rebase testing			// 8 conflicts occurred as it made new commits in order to rebase
			git rebase --continue
26:  cd project2
27:	 git fetch 			// to make sure that remote branch exists locally
		git branch --track testing origin/testing		//track remote branch
29:	 git merge testing	
30:  Difference:
		Merge - only one commit is done while resolving conflict-
		the end of testing lead to H IS AN ALPHABET 
		AND MASTER - 8 is a number
		these two were merged.
		Rebase - head (testing's end): H is alphabet 
		Master's beginning commit - 1 is anumber 
		and committed 8 times to resolve conflict till end of master.
